        <h2>The Art of Looking Stuff Up</h2>
        <p>There was a time when people simply didn't know. Actually learning the factual answer to a question took work. It
            involved owning things like expensive encyclopedia sets, or going to a library and hoping that they had relevant
            and current books on the topic you wanted to research. It was tough, back in 1997.</p>
        <p>In 2018, however, the whole of human knowledge is at your fingertips. All you have to do is look it up.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works: Click
            <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">this link</a> and you'll open a new tab that contains a Google search bar. Now, think about your question. Let's
            say I'm wondering if the Earth is flat. That would be a good thing to know.</p>
        <p>Just type it in. 'Is the Earth flat?' When I try it, I see this: 'About 328,000,000 results (0.31 seconds).' The
            vast majority of them say it is not. Now I know.</p>
        <p>How many results do you get? How different would the world be if people used this simple technique?</p>
        <p>It probably wouldn't even be flat, anymore.</p>
